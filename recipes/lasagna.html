    <h1>Lasagna</h1>
    <img src="../images/Lasagna.jpeg" alt="Image of a Lasagna Bolognese">
    <h2>This is a popular italian dish</h2>
    <p>It's a fundamentally simple recipe, with only a few key components: the pasta; the meat sauce, known as ragù
        Bolognese; besciamella (a.k.a. béchamel or white sauce); and grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.</p>

    <p>Despite its hearty frame, the true beauty of lasagna Bolognese is its refined delicacy. The layers are not
        overstuffed, guaranteeing that the pasta (and your mouth) isn't steamrolled by the filling's intense richness.
    </p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Prepare the Bolognese Sauce</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <div>Make the Soffritto:</div>
            <p>Combine pancetta, onion, celery, and carrot in sauté pan with butter and cook over medium heat until
                onion
                turns pale gold.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div>Add other ingredients:</div>
            <p>Add the beef, pork, and sausage to the soffritto and increase the heat to high. Cook until browned.
                Sprinkle
                with the ground clove, cinnamon, and pepper.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div>Add the tomates:</div>
            <p>Stir in the tomatoes and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to medium. Cook over medium heat for 15
                minutes.
                If you are using whole canned tomatoes, break them up as you add them to the sauce.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <div>Add milk and simmer:</div>
            <p>Add the milk, season with sea salt, then turn down the heat and let simmer for 2 and 1/2 hours. Stir at
                least
                every 20 minutes. Whenever the sauce simmers down to the point that it is sticking to the bottom of the
                pan,
                just add 1/4 cup of water and scrape up the browned bits from the bottom and continue to cook.</p>
        </li>

    </ol>
    <h3>Make the Béchamel Sauce</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <div>Make the roux:</div>
            <p> Heat the milk until almost boiling in a heavy bottomed sauce pan.
                In a separate pan melt the unsalted butter with the flour over low heat. Stir rapidly with a spoon. Cook
                this for 1 minute and then remove from the heat. <em>(See Wikipedia on Béchamel Sauce for more
                    information
                    on
                    this sauce.)</em></p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div>Add half the milk to the roux:</div>
            <p>Slowly add half the hot milk to your butter and flour mixture. During this process stir constantly.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div>Add the remaining milk and thicken the sauce:</div>
            <p>Return the milk, butter, flour mixture to low heat until the sauce begins to thicken. Add the remaining
                milk
                slowly while stirring working it into the thickened sauce. Continue to stir until it comes to a boil.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div>Season, then stir:</div>
            <p>Season with some sea salt, and continue stirring until the right consistency has developed. If any lumps
                form, beat them out rapidly with a whisk until they dissolve. Remove from heat.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Prepare the Lasagna</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <div>Cook the lasagna noodles:</div>
            <p>Preheat oven to 375°F. Cook the lasagna according to instructions. About 8 minutes in 6 quarts of boiling
                salted water. Drain, rinse with cold water.
                Lay the individual lasagna noodles out on kitchen towels, not touching, so they do not stick together
                while
                you layer the casserole.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div>Layer the lasagna:</div>
            <p>Spread a little olive oil around the inside of a 13x9-inch baking pan. Make sure your baking pan is
                non-reactive - pyrex or stainless steel. Do not use an aluminum pan as it will react with the acidity of
                the
                sauce and ruin the flavor.Put a layer of lasagna noodles down first. Layer on a third of the bolognese
                sauce, then a third of the
                bechamel sauce.Sprinkle with grated Parmesan. Repeat two more times. Top with a final layer of noodles
                and
                sprinkle with
                grated Parmesan.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div>Bake:</div>
            <p>Tent the casserole with aluminum foil. Put lasagna into the middle rack of a pre-heated 375°F oven. Bake
                for
                20-30 minutes, until the top begins to get lightly browned.Remove from oven and let cool 5-10 minutes
                before
                serving.</p>
        </li>
