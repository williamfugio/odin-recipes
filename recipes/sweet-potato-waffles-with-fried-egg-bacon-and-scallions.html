    <h2>Make these sweet potato waffles with fried egg, bacon, and scallions for breakfast, lunch, or dinner! Great way
        to use up leftover sweet potatoes</h2>
    <p>Waffles for supper are an especially comforting way to end the day. They're relatively quick to make from scratch
        and they change up the meal routine in an unexpected way.</p>
    <p>If you have leftover sweet potatoes in the fridge, mash them up and use them in this waffle batter. And if you
        don't have leftovers, it's still worth the extra step of baking a sweet potato just so you can make these
        waffles.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>For the waffles:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>12 ounces bacon</li>
        <li>1 cup (140g) flour</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons (103g) cornmeal</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>3/4 cup sweet potato mash (See Recipe Note)</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups buttermilk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons melted butter</li>
        <li>3 scallions, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>Cooking spray or vegetable oil (for the waffle iron)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the fried eggs:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
        <li>4 or more large eggs (at least one per person)</li>
        <li>Honey, for drizzling</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <div>Cook the bacon:</div>
            <p>In a large skillet over medium heat, cook the bacon until brown and crisp. Drain on paper towels. Break
                each slice into a few pieces (large pieces or crumbles, whichever you like!).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div>Heat the waffle iron:</div>
            <p>Get the waffle iron heating so that it's piping hot when you're ready to make your first batch of
                waffles. Also, place a baking sheet in the oven and set the oven to its lowest temperature to keep the
                finished waffles warm before serving. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div>Mix the dry ingredients:</div>
            <p>In a bowl, whisk the flour, cornmeal, baking powder, baking soda and salt until combined.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div>Separate the eggs and beat the whites:</div>
            <p>Separate the yolks and whites into separate bowls. With an electric mixer, beat the egg whites until soft
                peaks form. Set aside.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div>Prepare the batter:</div>
            <p>In a large bowl, whisk the egg yolks, mashed sweet potato, buttermilk, and melted butter until smooth.
                Add the dry ingredients and stir until blended. Gently fold in the egg whites. Stir in the scallions,
                reserving a few for sprinkling over the top.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div>Cook the waffles:</div>
            <p>Brush or spray the waffle iron with vegetable oil. Ladle the batter into the waffle ironâ€”the amount will
                vary according to the size of your particular waffle iron; use enough to fill the mold. Top with a few
                bacon pieces and close the lid.</p>
            <p>Bake the waffles until brown and crispy. Repeat until all the batter is used. Keep the finished waffles
                warm in the oven while you make the eggs.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div>Fry the eggs:</div>
            <p>In a skillet over low heat, melt the butter. Swirl the pan to coat the bottom. Break the eggs into the
                skillet, and cover the pan.</p>
            <p>Cook for 2 minutes, or until all but a thin rim of egg white around each yolk is opaque. Remove the pan
                from the heat, keep covered, and let sit for about 30 seconds to finish cooking.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div>Serve the waffles:</div>
            <p>Drizzle a little honey on each waffle and top with a fried egg.</p>
        </li>

    </ol>
