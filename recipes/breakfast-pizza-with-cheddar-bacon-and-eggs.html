    <p>Your weekend breakfast plans just got a whole lot more exciting with this Breakfast Pizza loaded with eggs,
        cheddar cheese, and crispy bacon.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Vegetable oil or spray, for the baking sheet
        <li>1 tablespoon corn meal, for the baking sheet
        <li>1/2 recipe of No-Knead Pizza Dough left to rise overnight or 1 pound store-bought pizza dough
        <li>6 slices (about 6 ounces) bacon, cut into thirds
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil
        <li>3-4 golf-ball size tomatoes, sliced (optional)
        <li>2 1/2 cups (6 ounces) loosely packed grated cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil, parsley, or oregano (for garnish)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <div><strong>Preheat the oven and prep baking sheet:</strong></div>
            <p>Preheat the oven to 450°F. Lightly oil a baking sheet or spray with vegetable oil. Sprinkle lightly with
                corn meal.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div><strong>Flatten the dough and let it rest:</strong></div>
            <p>Flour a work surface. Place the ball of pizza dough on top and flatten it with your hands into a circle,
                around 1-inch thick. Dimple it with your fingers to help spread it out and cover it with a dishtowel.
            </p>
            <p>Let it rest while you cook the bacon to allow the gluten to relax for easier shaping. If using no-knead
                dough, you may want to knead in 1 to 2 tablespoons of flour if the dough is very slack (wet.)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div><strong>Cook the bacon:</strong></div>
            <p>In a large skillet over medium heat, cook the bacon for 4 to 5 minutes, or until much of the fat has
                rendered and the bacon is starting to turn golden, but not is yet crisp. Transfer it to a paper
                towel-lined plate and set aside.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div><strong>Shape the dough:</strong></div>
            <p>Stretch the dough with your hands or roll it with a rolling pin into a large oval about the size of your
                baking sheet and transfer it to the baking sheet. It doesn’t have to fit into the corners or touch the
                edges of the pan; it should be a large oval (not square) that takes up most of the space on the baking
                sheet.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div><strong>Add toppings to pizza dough:</strong></div>
            <p>
                Brush the dough with olive oil using a pastry brush. Before you add the toppings, use a coffee cup to
                mark out four 3 to 4-inch spaces for the eggs. Leave the spaces you marked for the eggs free of pizza
                toppings and top the rest of the pizza with the tomatoes, bacon, and then sprinkle on the cheese,
                leaving some of the bacon and tomatoes uncovered.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div><strong>Partially bake the pizza:</strong></div>
            <p>
                Bake for 8 to 10 minutes, or until the dough is set and has started to brown at the edges. Remove the
                pan from the oven.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div><strong>Add the eggs and return the pizza to the oven to finish baking:</strong></div>
            <p>
                Crack one egg into a cup or small bowl and gently slide it onto the pizza, placing it on top of one of
                the empty spaces with no toppings. Repeat with the remaining eggs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Return the pan to the oven and continue to bake for 7 to 8 minutes, or until the egg cooks
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div><strong>Serve the pizza:</strong></div>
            <p>
                Sprinkle with herbs and cut the pizza into serving pieces. Serve while hot.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
